I am an undergraduate student who enrolled in 2023 at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University. My research focuses on machine learning and computer vision. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jianxin Wu](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/wujx/) from the [LAMDA](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx) Group at Nanjing University, and I am deeply grateful for his guidance during my undergraduate studies.
